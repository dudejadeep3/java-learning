### About Java

- **Java is Simple:** Java is easy to learn and its syntax is simple and easy to understand. It is based on C++. Java removed many confusing and rarely used features e.g. explicit pointers, operator overloading etc. Java also takes care about **memory management** and for that, it provides an automatic **garbage collector**. This collects the unused objects automatically.

- **Java is a platform-independent language:** The program written in Java language, after compilation, are converted into an intermeddiate level language called the **bytecode** which is irrespective of the machine on which the program run. This makes java highly portable as its bytecodes can be run on any machine by an interpreter called the **Java Virtual Machine(JVM)** and thus Java provides 'reusablity of code'.

- **Java is an Object-oriented programming language:** OOP makes the complete program simpler by dividing it into a number of objects. **The Objects can be used as a bridge to have data flown from one function to another**. We can easily modify data and function as per the requirement.

- **Java is robust language:** Java program must be reliable because they are used in both the consumer and mission-critical applications, ranging from Blu-ray players to navigation systems.

- **Java is a multithreaded language:** Java performs many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. For example, a program that manages a Graphical Use Inteface (GUI) while waiting for input from a network connection uses another thread to perform the wait instead of using the default GUI thread for both tasks. This keeps GUI reponsive.

- **Java program can create applets:** Applets are program that run on web browser.

- **Java doesn't required any [preprocessor](02_preprocessor.md):** It doesn't require inclusion of header files for creating a Java application. Therefore Java is a very successful language and its need is certainly going to increase day by day.
